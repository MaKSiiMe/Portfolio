# Portfolio Project


### MVP Description
For the MVP, we aim to build a simplified AI-powered tool that helps analyze and rank Pok√©mon TCG decks. The project includes a custom game engine that simulates basic matches using simplified rules, enabling automated testing between different decks. This allows us to evaluate deck performance over many simulated games.

A web dashboard will present key insights such as win rates, deck comparisons, and visual feedback (graphs, match summaries, etc.). The goal is to provide a helpful assistant for players to better understand which decks perform well, and why.
