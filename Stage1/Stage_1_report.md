## Evaluation Criteria Explanation

In this section, we explain the evaluation criteria used to assess the different components and ideas of our project. Each idea was rated from 1 (very poor) to 5 (excellent) on the following aspects:

---

### 🎯 1. Feasibility
**Definition:** How realistically can the idea be implemented within the MVP timeline and with the current team's skill set?

**Scoring Guide:**
- 5/5: Easily feasible with current skills and tools.
- 4/5: Requires some additional time or learning.
- 3/5: Technically possible but requires a significant amount of work or learning.
- 2/5: Very difficult or depends on external resources.
- 1/5: Almost impossible to achieve within the scope.

**Example:**  
"Build a simplified game engine from scratch" received a **3/5** because while it’s doable, it demands a lot of time and effort.

---

### 🌍 2. Potential Impact
**Definition:** What is the added value or usefulness of this idea? Will it impress users or contribute significantly to the final product?

**Scoring Guide:**
- 5/5: High impact; useful and/or impressive for users.
- 4/5: Good value but with limited visibility.
- 3/5: Interesting but not essential or very visible.
- 2/5: Limited usefulness.
- 1/5: Almost no visible benefit.

**Example:**  
"Deck ranking" got a **5/5** because it provides direct, useful, and visual feedback to TCG players.

---

### 🧠 3. Technical Alignment
**Definition:** How well does the idea align with the core technical goals of the project (AI, Machine Learning, RL, etc.)?

**Scoring Guide:**
- 5/5: Strong alignment with core AI goals (e.g., reinforcement learning).
- 4/5: Technically interesting and partially aligned.
- 3/5: Somewhat technical but not directly AI-related.
- 2/5: Low technical interest.
- 1/5: No technical relevance to the MVP.

**Example:**  
"Reinforcement learning with self-play" was rated **5/5**, as it’s central to the AI focus of the project.

---

### 🚀 4. Scalability
**Definition:** Can the idea be easily extended, improved, or generalized beyond the MVP?

**Scoring Guide:**
- 5/5: Highly extensible and reusable (e.g., can apply to other card games).
- 4/5: Evolves easily with a bit more development.
- 3/5: Limited scalability or usefulness beyond MVP.
- 2/5: Difficult to scale.
- 1/5: Not scalable at all.

**Example:**  
"Apply the agent to other card games" scored **5/5** since it naturally extends the current project logic.

### ⚠️ Risks / Constraints
This column highlights major risks or constraints for each idea. These are not scored numerically, but provide insight into:
- Time and complexity
- Lack of data
- Simulation performance
- Need for technical infrastructure or training time
