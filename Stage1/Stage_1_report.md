## 2. Ideas Explored

### Idea 1: Train an AI to Play Pok√©mon TCG
- **Summary:** Build a reinforcement learning agent that learns to play Pok√©mon Trading Card Game (TCG) and improves through self-play.
- ‚úÖ Pros:
  - Challenging and exciting project to explore RL
  - Can evolve into a deck recommender or strategy tester
- ‚ùå Cons:
  - Full game simulation is complex
  - Requires strong foundation in AI and math

---

### Idea 2: AI-Generated Optimal Decks
- **Summary:** Use AI to generate competitive decks based on a specific goal (e.g., countering another deck).
- ‚úÖ Pros:
  - Very innovative
  - Can be adapted to other card games
- ‚ùå Cons:
  - Very complex (combinatorial problem)
  - Requires a lot of iterations and testing

---

## 3. Decision and Refinement

### üéØ Selected MVP: Train an AI to Play Pok√©mon TCG

#### Main Objective:
> Develop an AI that learns to play the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game using reinforcement learning to identify winning strategies and discover the most effective decks.

#### Problem It Solves:
- Helps players better understand what makes a deck or strategy strong.
- Could provide a tool for testing or recommending decks.
- Provides a learning sandbox for AI developers and game theorists.

#### Target Users:
- Pok√©mon TCG players
- AI developers and learners
- Gaming and e-sports community

#### Key Features:
- Simplified game environment for training
- AI agent using RL (Q-learning, PPO, or similar)
- Match analysis system (win rate, mistakes, key cards)
- (Optional) Visualization of AI progression over time

#### Opportunities:
- Can be extended to other card games (e.g., Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh!)
- Potential for an educational tool
- Could become a deck recommendation API

#### Challenges:
- Building a simplified but realistic game engine
- Choosing and tuning the right learning algorithm
- Training time and computing resources
- Balancing game mechanics and abstraction level
