# Project Charter - "AI Agent for Pokémon TCG Deck Evaluation"

## Project Title
AI Agent for Pokémon TCG Pocket Deck Optimization

## Project Summary
The goal is to develop an AI agent capable of analyzing, learning, and evaluating Pokémon TCG (Trading Card Game) decks.  
The agent will use reinforcement learning or similar techniques to gradually identify the most powerful deck combinations.  
A simple visual dashboard will present results to facilitate the final presentation.

---

## Objectives
- Train a basic AI agent capable of simulating matches and evaluating deck performance.
- Provide a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) showing early-stage learning results.
- Build a simple visual tool to display AI findings (deck rankings, performance curves, etc.).

---

## Scope
**In Scope:**
- Data preparation: define simplified decks and rules if needed.
- Model development: basic AI agent training through self-play or evaluation functions.
- Visualization: simple CLI interface or minimal web dashboard showing deck scores/rankings.
- MVP version must show a *working* learning loop (even if imperfect).

**Out of Scope:**
- Full replication of Pokémon TCG complexity (official exhaustive rules).
- Production-grade reinforcement learning training (advanced tuning or huge datasets).

## Stakeholders
- **Project Owner:** [Your Name]
- **Mentors/Tutors:** Holberton tutors
- **Reviewers:** Project Evaluators (final presentation panel)

---

## Deliverables
- Functional prototype of a Pokémon deck evaluator agent.
- Visualization interface displaying deck evaluations.
- Project documentation (technical design, code structure, training process).

## Timeline (estimated)
| Phase | Duration |
|:----------------------- |:-------------- |
|     Idea development    |   Week 1 - 2   |
|     Project charter     |   Week 3 - 4   |
| Technical Documentation |   Weeks 5 – 6  |
|     MVP Development     |  Weeks 7 – 10  |
|     Project Closure     |   Week 11 –12  |

---

## Risks and Challenges
- **Data complexity:** Simplifying Pokémon TCG enough for MVP training.
- **Model performance:** Achieving meaningful results in a limited time.
- **Visualization:** Building a simple but clear interface quickly.
- **Solo work:** Balancing all development tasks alone.

---

## Success Criteria
- A working AI model that can rank or evaluate decks.
- A minimal but functional user interface to present outcomes.
- Proper documentation of the entire project process.
