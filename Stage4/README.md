# Portfolio Project

## MVP Description

### From Pokémon TCG to UNO

The original goal was to train an AI to play a simplified version of the Pokémon TCG Pocket game. However, recreating even a basic trading card game from scratch turned out to be too time-consuming for the scope of this MVP.

To stay focused on the main objective — **training an AI to play a card game** — the support has been switched to a simplified version of **UNO**, which allows faster development while keeping the same AI-oriented goal.

The MVP remains unchanged: build a functional game engine and train AI agents through self-play and simulation. Only the complexity of the game has been reduced to save time and prioritize the AI development phase.

The TCG Pokémon project is still in progress as a personal side project alongside my specialization in AI/ML.
