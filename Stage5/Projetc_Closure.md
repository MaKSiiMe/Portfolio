## 🧩 1. Project Overview
- **Project**: UNO card game with Reinforcement Learning AI  
- **Scope change**: Switched from Pokémon TCG to UNO for feasibility  
- **Deliverables**: Game engine, CLI, Flask API, Gym-compatible RL environment, PPO-trained agent  

---

## ✅ 2. Results Summary

### 🧭 Core Features Delivered
- Full UNO rules engine (special cards, reshuffling, turn logic)  
- CLI interface for local interaction  
- Flask-based REST API providing game state and actions  
- Gymnasium environment wrapper for RL  
- PPO agent trained with Stable-Baselines3  
- Vectorized state encoding for AI training  

### 📊 Alignment With Initial Goals

| Initial Objective                        | Outcome                       |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Complete UNO engine                      | ✅ Achieved                   |
| RL integration (Env + PPO)               | ✅ Achieved                   |
| Web/UI interface                         | 🔄 In progress                |
| Playable MVP demo (AI vs AI)             | 🔄 In progress                |
| Performance tests/logs                   | ⚠️ Partial (100k PPO steps)   |

### 📈 Key Metrics
- 100,000 PPO training iterations completed  
- RL agent wins ~**X%** vs. random baseline  
- Average turn latency: **5 ms**

## 💡 3. Lessons Learned

### ✅ What Went Well  
- Modular project structure (Game, Env, API, Training)  
- Unit testing of core logic ensured quality  
- Smooth integration of Gym & PPO  
- Consistent collaboration via clear branching and merges  

### ⚠️ Challenges & Resolutions  
- **Frontend/API delays**: overcame via CLI prioritization and later integration  
- **Environment vectorization hiccups**: resolved through pair debugging  
- **decode_action() bugs**: traced via detailed logging  
- **Limited time for AI hyperparameter tuning**  

### 🔧 Recommendations for Future Projects  
- Include full-stack components in initial planning  
- Define API contracts early and iteratively  
- Use iterative UX reviews even without final frontend  
- Allocate buffer time for RL testing and tuning

## 🔍 4. Team Retrospective (Following Atlassian Format)

### 👍 What Worked
- Clear distribution of backend vs. AI roles  
- Effective peer reviews and constant communication  
- Agile adoption of Gymnasium and RL tools  

### 👎 What Could Be Improved
- More pair-programming to share context  
- Planning focused too heavily on backend; UI was underprioritized  
- Heavy reliance on CLI slowed integrated testing  

### 🧭 Action Items for Next Time
- Use timeboxed sprints with mid-sprint demos  
- Track work visually (e.g. Trello or Notion boards)  
- Apply Test-Driven Development early for critical modules

## 🗣️ 5. Presentation Slide Deck Outline  
*(Informed by HBR and TechSmith best practices)*

1. **Title & Team Slide** — project name, team members, tagline  
2. **Project Charter Recap** — scope, objectives, pivot justification  
3. **Process Journey** — key stages and decisions visualized  
4. **Technical Architecture** — diagrams (Game engine, API, RL flow)  
5. **MVP Demo** — screenshots, short demo video or live CLI/AI showcase  
6. **Results & Metrics** — successes, KPIs, lessons summary  
7. **Lessons Learned & Recommendations** — transparency, future improvements  
8. **Closing & Q&A** — next steps, acknowledgements  

### Presentation Tips
- Apply HBR’s “Killer Presentation” formula: **one core message per slide**, minimal text  
- Use visuals (diagrams, icons, short GIFs from TechSmith’s recommendations)  
- Involve all team members in speaking roles  
- Rehearse transitions and anticipate questions  

---

## 🎤 6. Live Presentation Preparation  
*(Guided by Toastmasters & SecondNature advice)*

- **Roles**: assign who introduces, demos, discusses technicals, covers lessons  
- **Rehearsals**: perform a full run-through with timing (target 10–15m)  
- **Delivery techniques**: maintain eye contact, modulate tone, avoid monotony  
- **Backup plans**: record demo video in case of live glitches  
- **Interaction**: involve audience early, ask rhetorical or polling questions

## 📎 7. Deliverables

- **Final Report (.md)**: this document (“Project Closure – UNO MVP”)  
- **Slide Deck**: ready-to-share presentation file (Google Slides or PowerPoint)  
- **Live Demo**: CLI/API/AI agent showcase with rehearsed flow  

---

## ✅ 8. Next Steps
1. Finalize internal reviews and refine metrics  
2. Build and polish the Slide Deck  
3. Schedule and run retrospective meeting  
4. Rehearse live presentation as a team  
5. Request Manual QA review before final delivery
